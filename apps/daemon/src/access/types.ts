 * - `self-filtered`: any signed-in user; the handler scopes reads/writes to the
 *   caller (list filtering, forced `userId`). `resource` names what is filtered.
 * - `owner`: the router resolves the owner of every resource the request names
 *   (path params and body references) and answers 404 unless the caller owns it.
 *   `unowned` decides resources without an owner: `deny` (default), `allow`
 *   (shared, e.g. operator-made bots), or `admin`.
